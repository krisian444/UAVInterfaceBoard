# UAVInterfaceBoard
A custom interface board for the Raspberry Pi 4 was developed in order to connect multiple sensors such as the GPS, LiDar and IMU via I2C. Thanks to @adafruit, and @wschmied for developing the drivers for the Adafruit GPS PA1010D and TFminiI2C LiDar respectively which streamlined the integration of the sensors to the RPi 4.
