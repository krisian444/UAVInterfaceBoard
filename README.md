# UAVInterfaceBoard
A custom interface board for the Raspberry Pi 4 was developed in order to connect multiple sensors such as the GPS, LiDar and IMU via I2C. Big thanks to @adafruit, and @wschmied for developing the drivers for the Adafruit GPS PA1010D and TFminiI2C LiDar respectively which streamlined the integration of the sensors to the RPi 4.

Requires OpenCV and as well as some libraries from Adafruit by setting up the [PA1010D GPS module](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-gps-pa1010d-module)
